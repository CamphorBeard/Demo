1.Path tracing output gets shadow on light's right side, could be solved by making light closer to roof(may cause z-fighting in rasterization). But why it's not symmetrical?
2.Left and right planes'triangle joints don't seem right in rasterization, guessing because interpolation incorrect. Actually barycentric coordinates'gamma can't be calculated by "1-alpha-beta" and perspective correct is different from manual calculating formulas, kind surprised its ouput is fine.
3.A bright dot pops out on roof in rasterization if choosing a big value(800) as output width and height, guessing because calculation accuracy. But what make this position special?
4.OpenCV window is bigger than setted output image's size, annoying sometime.

Let's solve those one after another then add some more here.
